title: Learning to learn ReasonML
titlepage-note: |
  Hello, my name is Jasim, and I'm here today to talk about ReasonML. 
  
  Reason is a Typed Functional programming language, and the types and functions come together in a way that makes better programmers out of ourselves.
  
  I will show you how that happens, and also give you a feel for what it could be to be programming in it on a day-to-day basis. I will also talk about the most efficient way to learn the language, which is based on my experience learning and struggling with it in the past.

## Reason is OCaml

* First released in 1990 in France

* Fast programs approaching C-like speeds

* ISWIM syntax (OCaml, Haskell) not ALGOL (C, Java, Javascript etc.)

::: notes

Reason is a new syntax on top of the OCaml programming language. 

OCaml has a long history - it was first released in 1990 - about 20 years ago. It is a compiled language and produces very performant binaries; it is sort of like GoLang in that respect. 

But its syntax is a little different from most languages that we know.

:::

## OCaml sample code

``` {.ocaml}
let rec read_and_accumulate accum =
  let line = In_channel.input_line In_channel.stdin in
  match line with
  | None -> accum
  | Some x -> read_and_accumulate (accum +. Float.of_string x)

let () =
  printf "Total: %F\n" (read_and_accumulate 0.)  
```

::: notes

Here is a program that reads a list of numbers from the standard input and prints their sum.

:::

---

## Same code, in Reason

``` {.javascript}
let rec read_and_accumulate = accum => {
  let line = In_channel.input_line(In_channel.stdin);
  switch (line) {
  | None => accum
  | Some(x) => read_and_accumulate(accum +. Float.of_string(x))
  };
};

let () = printf("Total: %F\n", read_and_accumulate(0.));
```

::: notes

Here's the same OCaml code, but in the Reason syntax.

The point is, underneath, it is the same language and same semantics. So I'll use both Reason and OCaml interchangeably in this presentation, depending on what fits the context better.

## What can we build with Reason/OCaml?

::: notes

So is it actually useful? This language. What can we build with it? Let me take you through some examples.

#### High-frequency trading software

&nbsp;

![](images/jane-street.png)

::: notes

When you start reading about OCaml, you'll often come across Jane Street. They are one of the largest production users of the language and they do billions of dollars worth of trading, all with software written in OCaml.

:::

#### World's second largest crawler

&nbsp;

![](images/ahrefs.png)

::: notes

If you have done any SEO work, you might be familiar with Ahrefs. They crawl about 5 million pages every minute, and they have the second largest index just after Google. They use native OCaml for all the back-end infra and for the front-end web they use Reason.

:::

---

#### Compilers

* First version of the Rust compiler
* Flow (typechecker for Javascript)
* Hack (Facebook's PHP compiler)

&nbsp;

::: notes

OCaml is also particularly nice to write compilers on - in fact anything that deals with a lot of tree manipulation is a great fit. Rust borrows many ideas from OCaml, and their first compiler was written in the language. Facebook is also a large user of OCaml internally.

#### Front-end web applications!

* BuckleScript compiles Reason/OCaml to Javascript

::: notes

Those were the traditional applications of OCaml. 

OCaml can also be used to build front-end web applications, and that's what this talk is about.

The regular OCaml compiler emits executable binary, but we want Javascript so it executes on the browser. So there is an OCaml compiler called BuckleScript that emits performant Javascript. And it lets us use any npm library in the OCaml code almost seamlessly.

:::

---

``` {.javascript}
if (MomentRe.Moment.isSameWithGranularity(
      MomentRe.momentNow(),
      MomentRe.moment("2020-04-01"),
      `day,
    )) {
  Js.log("It is the 1st of April!");
} else {
  Js.log("A dreary day");
};
```

::: notes

This Reason code here - it checks whether the current day is April 1st 2020,
and then shows a message.

It uses the momentjs Javascript library from npm. Now let's see how the BuckleScript output looks.

:::

---

``` {.javascript}
// Generated by BUCKLESCRIPT VERSION 5.0.6, PLEASE EDIT WITH CARE
'use strict';

var Moment = require("moment");
var MomentRe = require("bs-moment/src/MomentRe.js");

if (Moment().isSame(MomentRe.moment(undefined, "2020-04-01"), "day")) {
  console.log("It is the 1st of April!");
} else {
  console.log("A dreary day");
}

/*  Not a pure module */
```

::: notes

As you can see BuckleScript required the correct npm module and compiled everything to straightforward Javascript.

## Javascript vs Reason

* **Javascript**: `this`, variable hoisting, prototypes, ES6 classes, objects, mutations, _functions, modules_

* **Reason**: _functions, modules, types_

::: notes
Javascript however is a large language -- it has far too many concepts -- and that is obvious if you've participated in any Javascript interview. You can ask and be asked so many questions. There is the concept of `this`, there is prototypes and prototype inheritance chains which have their own rules, and there are also classes, objects, and mutation. It also has functions and higher-order functions.

Reason comparatively is a smaller language. It only has functions, modules, and types.  We don't, for example, concern ourselves with what `this` could be during runtime. In fact a Reason interview would be a rather unexciting event - there aren't that many quirks to the language to deal with.

## Programming in Reason

Two principles:

1) Write pure functions
2) Get their types right

::: notes

The way we program Reason is to write our programs as a series of pure functions. That's it. 

But how is that an improvement over Javascript? We can write Javascript in a similar manner - with pure functions everywhere, and just an outer shell for all the I/O. That's essentially functional programming, and that's pretty nice.

But Reason is not only "functional", it is also "typed", and the types guarantee something:

## Perfection

The perfect computer program -- 

::: notes

"perfection".

Reason functions are more "perfect" than functions written in Javascript. I'm using the word "perfection" here, based on a talk given by Prof. Xavier Leroy, who is a programming languages researcher and also the author OCaml

:::

---

> (a perfect program is) The one that does exactly what it should do, no more, no less, every time, with perfect reliability, and forever. The kind of perfection that you can get from mathematical definitions, which software is to a large extent, or from philosophical concepts.

<sub><sup>"In search of software perfection", by Dr. Xavier Leroy, author of OCaml</sub></sup>

::: notes

"A perfect program does exactly what it should do, no more, no less, every time, with perfect reliability, and forever. The kind of perfection that you can get from mathematical definitions, which software is to a large extent, or from philosophical concepts."

What can that mean in the context of our day-to-day programming work? Let's take a look.

::: 

----

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = lastUser => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (lastUser.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: 16})
```

```
You will be user 17
```

::: notes

Consider this function `showNext` - it tells you what your user id could be, based on the last user in the system. 

We pass it an object with id 16, and it prints 17. The code is as simple as it can get. 

But does it work perfectly reliably all the time, every time? Will it ever crash in production?

:::

----

``` {.text}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: null)
```

::: notes

What if `id` is null?

:::

----


``` {.text}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: null)
```

```
You will be user 1
```

::: notes

Thankfully that works. Our function is resilient to nulls.

:::

----

``` {.text}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: "193"})
```

::: notes

What if id was a string?

:::

----

``` {.text}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: "193"})
```

```
You will be user 1931
```

::: notes

It doesn't crash, but the result isn't what we wanted. 

:::

---

``` {.text}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({})
```

::: notes

Now what happens when the object is empty?

:::

----

``` {.text}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({})
```

```
You will be user NaN
```

::: notes

This is also a wrong result.

:::

----

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}

let users = []
let lastUser = users[users.length - 1]

showNext(lastUser)
```

::: notes

Here we have a list of users, and we'll find the last of them and apply to `showNext`

But unfortunately, the list is empty. What happens now?

:::

----

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}

let users = []
let lastUser = users[users.length - 1]

showNext(lastUser)
```

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined
```

::: notes

The function actually crashes. 

This is a common source of error when programming in JS - we fetch a value from an array or an object -- and sometimes it doesn't exist -- which means it returns a null or an undefined. We then pass that down to other functions.. and things crash in production. Sometimes they crash far away from the place where the undefined originated, and so we have to work backwards quite a bit to debug it. 

:::

----

``` {.javascript}
showNext()
showNext({id: "a"})
showNext({id: {}})
showNext(undefined)
showNext(null)
showNext(0)
showNext("a")
showNext([])
showNext([1])
showNext(a => a + 1)
```

::: notes

Okay, to make a long story short, none of the invokations here would work correctly. 

:::

----


::: notes

There is only exactly one way the function can succeed. And that is 

:::

----

``` {.javascript}
type user = {

}
```

::: notes

when we pass it an object

:::

----

``` {.javascript}
type user = {
  id
}
```

::: notes

which has a field `id`

:::

----

``` {.javascript}
type user = {
  id: int
};
```

::: notes

which is of type integer.

This is how types are defined in Reason. Let's also write the Reason version of `showNext`.

:::

----

``` {.javascript}
type user = {id: int};

let showNext = u => {
  Js.log("You will be user " ++ string_of_int(u.id + 1));
};

showNext({id: 15});
```

```
You will be user 16
```

::: notes

As you can see, the Reason version of the code looks very similar to ES6. 

We have just added a type definition, and a type coercion.

Let's now try to break it like we did with the Javascript version.

:::

----

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: "abc"});
```

![](images/comp-error-string.png)

::: notes

Yes it breaks! However that is a compile-time error. Let's unpack that a bit.

The Reason compiler inferred that the function `showNext` expects a value of type `user`. This is because showNext relies on the `id` field, and there are no other types in the vicinity that has an `id` field apart from the type `user`.

This is called Type Inference - the compiler can figure out what the type of our data is, and the type that our functions expect, most of the times. 

Now that the compiler knows the function invokation is invalid, it shows an error, and does not generate the Javascript for this. This means it can never be executed in production.

:::


----

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: []});
```

![](images/comp-error-list.png)


----

``` {.javascript}
showNext(a => a + 1);
```

![](images/comp-error-fn.png)

----

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: null});
```

![](images/comp-error-1-null.png)

::: notes

But what about null? What if we pass null to `showNext`?

Again the code does not compile. This is because Reason doesn't even have the concept of nulls. the concept of nulls. So instead of allowing to run the code and crash at runtime, it simply prevents the code from even being even executed. 

But we use nulls in Javascript to represent the "absence" of something. Reason does have an elegant way to do that. I will show how that works soon.

## The cost of Drama


::: notes

Let's build a tiny invoicing program.
It is for a drama troupe.
They put two kinds of plays: Comedies and Tragedies.
:::



---

## First step

``` {.javascript}
switch (play.type) {
  case "tragedy":  
    return new TragedyCalculator(
      aPerformance, aPlay
    );
    
  case "comedy":
    thisAmount = 30000;
    if (perf.audience > 20) {
      thisAmount += 10000 + 500 * (perf.audience - 20);
    }
    thisAmount += 300 * perf.audience;
    break;
  default:
    throw new Error(`unknown type: ${play.type}`);
}
```


---

## Code example

``` {.javascript}
type type_ =
  | Tragedy
  | Comedy;

type play = {
  name: string,
  audience: int,
  type_,
};
```

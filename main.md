::: notes

Hello, my name is Jasim, and I'm here today to talk about ReasonML. 

My hope through this talk is to give you a feel for the language - what makes it interesting, how is it different from Javascript, and what it feels to be programming in it on a day-to-day basis.

:::

## Reason is OCaml

* First released in 1990 in France

* Fast programs approaching C-like speeds

* ISWIM syntax (OCaml, Haskell) not ALGOL (C, Java, Javascript etc.)

::: notes

Reason is a new syntax on top of the OCaml programming language. 

OCaml has a long history - it was first released in 1990 - about 20 years ago. It is a compiled language and produces very performant binaries.

Its syntax however is distinct from what is used in most popular languages.

:::

------------------

## OCaml sample code

``` {.ocaml}
let rec read_and_accumulate accum =
  let line = In_channel.input_line In_channel.stdin in
  match line with
  | None -> accum
  | Some x -> read_and_accumulate (accum +. Float.of_string x)

let () =
  printf "Total: %F\n" (read_and_accumulate 0.)  
```

::: notes

Here is an OCaml program that reads a list of numbers from the standard input and prints their sum.

:::

------------------

## Same code, in Reason

``` {.javascript}
let rec read_and_accumulate = accum => {
  let line = In_channel.input_line(In_channel.stdin);
  switch (line) {
  | None => accum
  | Some(x) => read_and_accumulate(accum +. Float.of_string(x))
  };
};

let () = printf("Total: %F\n", read_and_accumulate(0.));
```

::: notes

Here's the same OCaml code, but in the Reason syntax. This is closer to ES6 as we know it - there are braces to denote blocks. The fat arrow operator lets us create functions and semicolons for separating lines.

Underneath, however Reason and OCaml are the same language and have the same semantics. In this presentation I'll use refer to Reason and OCaml interchangeably, depending on what fits the context better.

:::

------------------

## What can we build with Reason/OCaml?

::: notes

So is it actually useful? This language. What can we build with it? Let me take you through some examples.

:::

------------------

#### High-frequency trading software

&nbsp;

![](images/jane-street.png)

::: notes

When you start reading about OCaml, you'll often come across Jane Street. They are one of the largest production users of the language and they do billions of dollars worth of trading, all with software written in OCaml.

:::

------------------

#### World's second largest crawler

&nbsp;

![](images/ahrefs.png)

::: notes

If you have done any SEO work, you might be familiar with Ahrefs. They crawl about 5 million pages every minute, and they have the second largest index just after Google. They use native OCaml for all the back-end infra and for the front-end web they use Reason.

:::

------------------

#### Compilers

&nbsp;

* First version of the Rust compiler
* Flow (typechecker for Javascript)
* Hack (Facebook's PHP compiler)

&nbsp;

::: notes

OCaml is also particularly nice to write compilers on - in fact anything that deals with a lot of tree manipulation is a great fit. Rust borrows many ideas from OCaml, and their first compiler was written in the language. Facebook is also a large user of OCaml internally.

:::

------------------

## Front-end web applications!

&nbsp;

Compile Reason into clean performant Javascript

#### using the BuckleScript compiler


::: notes

Those were the traditional applications of OCaml. 

OCaml can also be used to build front-end web applications, and that's what this talk is about.

The regular OCaml compiler emits executable binary, but we want Javascript so it executes on the browser. So there is an OCaml compiler called BuckleScript that emits performant Javascript. And it lets us use any npm library in the OCaml code almost seamlessly.

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
if (MomentRe.Moment.isSameWithGranularity(
      MomentRe.momentNow(),
      MomentRe.moment("2020-04-01"),
      `day,
    )) {
  Js.log("It is the 1st of April!");
} else {
  Js.log("A dreary day");
};
```

::: notes

This Reason code here - it checks whether the current day is April 1st 2020,
and then shows a message.

It uses the momentjs Javascript library from npm. Now let's see how the BuckleScript output looks.

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
// Generated by BUCKLESCRIPT VERSION 5.0.6, PLEASE EDIT WITH CARE
'use strict';

var Moment = require("moment");
var MomentRe = require("bs-moment/src/MomentRe.js");

if (Moment().isSame(MomentRe.moment(undefined, "2020-04-01"), "day")) {
  console.log("It is the 1st of April!");
} else {
  console.log("A dreary day");
}

/*  Not a pure module */
```

::: notes

As you can see BuckleScript required the correct npm module and compiled everything to straightforward Javascript. 

:::

------------------

## Javascript vs Reason

* **Javascript**: `this`, variable hoisting, prototypes, ES6 classes, objects, mutations, _functions, modules_

* **Reason**: _functions, modules, types_

::: notes
Javascript however is a large language -- it has far too many concepts -- and that is obvious if you've participated in any Javascript interview. You can ask and be asked so many questions. There is the concept of `this`, there is prototypes and prototype inheritance chains which have their own rules, and there are also classes, objects, and mutation. It also has functions and higher-order functions.

Reason comparatively is a smaller language. It only has functions, modules, and types.  We don't, for example, concern ourselves with what `this` could be during runtime. In fact a Reason interview would be a rather unexciting event - there aren't that many quirks to the language to deal with.
:::

------------------

## Programming in Reason

Two principles:

1) Write pure functions
2) Get their types right

::: notes

The way we program Reason is to write our programs as a series of pure functions. That's it. 

But how is that an improvement over Javascript? We can write Javascript in a similar manner - with pure functions everywhere, and just an outer shell for all the I/O. That's essentially functional programming, and that's pretty nice.

But Reason is not only "functional", it is also "typed", and the types guarantee something:

:::

------------------

## Perfection

The perfect computer program -- 

::: notes

"perfection".

Reason functions are more "perfect" than functions written in Javascript. I'm using the word "perfection" here, based on a talk given by Prof. Xavier Leroy, who is a programming languages researcher and also the author OCaml

:::

------------------

> (a perfect program is) The one that does exactly what it should do, no more, no less, every time, with perfect reliability, and forever. The kind of perfection that you can get from mathematical definitions, which software is to a large extent, or from philosophical concepts.

<sub><sup>"In search of software perfection", by Dr. Xavier Leroy, author of OCaml</sub></sup>

::: notes

"A perfect program does exactly what it should do, no more, no less, every time, with perfect reliability, and forever. The kind of perfection that you can get from mathematical definitions, which software is to a large extent, or from philosophical concepts."

What can that mean in the context of our day-to-day programming work? Let's take a look.

::: 

------------------

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = lastUser => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (lastUser.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: 16})
```

```
You will be user 17
```

::: notes

Consider this function `showNext` - it tells you what your user id could be, based on the last user in the system. 

We pass it an object with id 16, and it prints 17. The code is as simple as it can get. 

But does it work perfectly reliably all the time, every time? Will it ever crash in production?

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: null)
```

::: notes

What if `id` is null?

:::

------------------


``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: null)
```

```
You will be user 1
```

::: notes

Thankfully that works. Our function is resilient to nulls.

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: "193"})
```

::: notes

What if id was a string?

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: "193"})
```

```
You will be user 1931
```

::: notes

It doesn't crash, but the result isn't what we wanted. 

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({})
```

::: notes

Now what happens when the object is empty?

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
showNext({})
```

```
You will be user NaN
```

::: notes

This is also a wrong result.

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
let users = []
let lastUser = users[users.length - 1]

showNext(lastUser)
```

::: notes

Here we have a list of users, and we'll find the last of them and apply to `showNext`

But unfortunately, the list is empty. What happens now?

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
let showNext = u => {
  console.log("You will be user " + (u.id + 1))
}
```

``` {.javascript}
let users = []
let lastUser = users[users.length - 1]

showNext(lastUser)
```

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined
```

::: notes

The function actually crashes. 

This is a common source of error when programming in JS - we fetch a value from an array or an object -- and sometimes it doesn't exist -- which means it returns a null or an undefined. We then pass that down to other functions.. and things crash in production. Sometimes they crash far away from the place where the undefined originated, and so we have to work backwards quite a bit to debug it. 

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
showNext()
showNext({id: "a"})
showNext({id: {}})
showNext(undefined)
showNext(null)
showNext(0)
showNext("a")
showNext([])
showNext([1])
showNext(a => a + 1)
```

::: notes

Okay, to make a long story short, none of the invokations here would work correctly. 

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: 112})
```

```
You will be user 113
```

::: notes

The only way the function can succeed is when it receives an object which has a field `id`, which has an integer value.

So why does Javascript allow this function to be called with any other kind of argument? What if we could write functions that will always work because they always receive the right kind of data. It will change the way we write software.

This is done in Reason with type definitions - it is sort of a metadata that mentions what the shape and structure of different values in the program are.

Let's see how that works.

:::



------------------

``` {.javascript}
type user = {

}
```

::: notes

Here is a Reason type definition; we're saying that there is a type called user

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
type user = {
  id
}
```

::: notes

which has a field `id`

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
type user = {
  id: int
};
```

::: notes

whose values are always integers.

Now let's write `showNext` in Reason.

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
type user = {
  id: int
};

let showNext = u => {
  Js.log("You will be user " ++ string_of_int(u.id + 1));
};
```

::: notes

You can see that there is an explicit cast from integer to string, but otherwise the Reason version looks similar to the ES6 version. Let us run it.

:::



------------------

``` {.javascript}
type user = {
  id: int
};

let showNext = u => {
  Js.log("You will be user " ++ string_of_int(u.id + 1));
};

showNext({id: 15});
```

```
You will be user 16
```

::: notes

It works. Can we send this function invalid data, and break it, like we did with the JS version?

:::

------------------


``` {.javascript}
type user = { id: int };
let showNext = u => {
  Js.log("You will be user " ++ string_of_int(u.id + 1));
};
showNext({id: "abc"});
```

![](images/comp-error-string1.png)

::: notes

Yes it breaks! But this is a compile-time breakage. This means no Javascript code was generated for this Reason program we wrote.

That's because the compiler found a type error in the code.

:::


------------------

``` {.javascript}
type user = { id: int };
let showNext = u => {
  Js.log("You will be user " ++ string_of_int(u.id + 1));
};
showNext({id: "abc"});
```

![](images/comp-error-string2.png)

::: notes

It inferred that the function `showNext` expects a value of type `user`, and `user` should have an integer id column inside it. But instead of `user` we sent a random string. That'll definitely break the function in runtime, so Reason wouldn't allow it to move past compilation.

But how did Reason figure out that `showNext` expects a value of type `user`? We haven't mentioned that explicitly anywhere. What's happening is "type inference" -- if you imagined that you'll have to litter your codebase with type annotations, then type inference will make you happy.

Based on the context, Reason figures out the types of values and arguments to functions. It works well even for large programs.

Now let's see how Reason fares with other invalid values.

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: []});
```

![](images/comp-error-list.png)

::: notes

We're passing in a list instead of an integer. Type error.

:::

------------------

``` {.javascript}
showNext(a => a + 1);
```

![](images/comp-error-fn.png)

::: notes

Here's a function instead of the entire `user` object. Type error again. 

:::


------------------

``` {.javascript}
type user = { id: int };

let showNext = u => {
  Js.log("You will be user " ++ string_of_int(u.id + 1));
};

showNext({id: 44});
showNext({id: 299});
showNext({id: -44});
```

```
You will be user 45
You will be user 300
You will be user -4
```

::: notes

We can keep going, but the only way to get the program to compile is to pass `showNext` the correct data. That's the number one promise of Typed FP.

But what about data that comes from outside the program? They might contain invalid data -- how would the compiler catch it?

:::


------------------

``` {.javascript}
type user = {
  id: int,
  name: string,
};
let show = u => Js.log(u.id);
let parse = json => {
  id:   json |> Json.Decode.field("last_id", Json.Decode.int),
  name: json |> Json.Decode.field("name",    Json.Decode.string)
};
let validJson = {j|{"id":10, "name": "Test"}|j};
let invalidJson = {j|{"id": 10}|j};

validJson |> Json.parseOrRaise |> parse |> show;
invalidJson |> Json.parseOrRaise |> parse |> show;
```

::: notes

Take this code for example. We have defined a type `user`. There is a `show` function that prints the user's id.

And then we have a `parse` function. What we're trying to do is to accept data from outside

:::

### If it compiles, it works

::: notes

A lot of my programming anxiety went away after I started programming with Reason. Because I know that if my program compiles, it works.

Its true! 

But, what about logical errors?

:::



------------------

```
  if item == "tea"
    pourCoffee()
  else
    pourTea()
```

::: notes

Here someone asked for a tea, and we poured them a coffee. It will compile, but it is obviously wrong. This is a logical error, not a type error, and so the compiler cannot catch it.

:::

------------------

### Programming is difficult

&nbsp;

* because of clerical errors

* logical mistakes are rare

::: notes

But when I started writing typed FP after about a decade of dynamically typed languages, I realized that we programmers are a pretty decent bunch. It is very rare for us to be making logical errors in our code.

Our programs are all broken, make no mistake, but they are broken not because we wrote something when we meant the other. They're borken because of clerical mistakes. Passing the wrong data to the wrong function. The Reason compiler is very good at catching those mistakes. Which is why, "if it compiles, it works".

## The cost of Drama


::: notes

Let's build a tiny invoicing program.
It is for a drama troupe.
They put two kinds of plays: Comedies and Tragedies.
:::



------------------

## First step

``` {.javascript}
switch (play.type) {
  case "tragedy":  
    return new TragedyCalculator(
      aPerformance, aPlay
    );
    
  case "comedy":
    thisAmount = 30000;
    if (perf.audience > 20) {
      thisAmount += 10000 + 500 * (perf.audience - 20);
    }
    thisAmount += 300 * perf.audience;
    break;
  default:
    throw new Error(`unknown type: ${play.type}`);
}
```


------------------

## Code example

``` {.javascript}
type type_ =
  | Tragedy
  | Comedy;

type play = {
  name: string,
  audience: int,
  type_,
};
```

------------------

``` {.javascript}
showNext({id: null});
```

![](images/comp-error-1-null.png)

::: notes

But what about null? What if we pass null to `showNext`?

Again the code does not compile. This is because Reason doesn't even have the concept of nulls. the concept of nulls. So instead of allowing to run the code and crash at runtime, it simply prevents the code from even being even executed. 

But we use nulls in Javascript to represent the "absence" of something. Reason does have an elegant way to do that. I will show how that works soon.

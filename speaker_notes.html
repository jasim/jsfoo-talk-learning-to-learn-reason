main.md<br><br>Hello, my name is Jasim, and I'm here today to talk about ReasonML.<br><br><hr><br><br>A little about me, I've been programming professionally for a little over 10 years now.<br><br>This is one of the earliest software that I built.<br><br><hr><br><br>These were easy to build. You could make software like this without having to be a professional programmer.<br><br>But all good things have to come to an end.<br><br>So I've since worked on modern web applications, on the front-end, back-end, and also programmed with different languages including Javascript.<br><br>Most recently I've been jamming with a friend building tools for designers & front-end developers.<br><br><hr><br><br>One is called Teleport -- it is a Chrome extension that can capture a website and create a Sketch design out of it.<br><br>Here I'm using Teleport to re-create the Reason homepage in Sketch.<br><br>The other tool we're building is called Protoship Codegen.<br><br><hr><br><br>It converts designs - made in tools like Adobe XD and Sketch - into responsive HTML and CSS<br><br>Here we're a running a sample Sketch design through Codegen.<br><br>This is the Codegen UI.<br><br>And here is the responsive HTML & CSS rendered by it.<br><br>The generated code is stuff that programmers like you and me can use. So it'll do static positioning, flexboxes, and grids etc.<br><br><hr><br><br>All this stuff: the Sketch plugin, the web UI, and the code generator -- everything, is written in Reason.<br><br>But that happened only when we were about half-way through the product. Before that it was all written in Javascript.<br><br>We didn't know Reason or Typed FP when we began working on Codegen, which was about two years ago.<br><br>Let me tell you a bit about how Codegen works under the hood so you can see why we chose to learn and rewrite it in Reason.<br><br><hr><br><br>See here, is the source data that Codegen has to convert to code.<br><br>This is a node for a vector design element, which was extracted from Sketch by Codegen. They're absolutely positioned, as you can see from x, y, and width and height.<br><br>Our goal is to convert this vector node into responsive HTML and CSS,<br><br><hr><br><br>something that looks like this.<br><br><hr><br><br>That's a multi-step process. Here's a rough pipeline of how we do that:<br><br>We start with the Vector Design tree, which is passed through this pipeline of functions, each of which transforms the tree into something closer to the final result that we want.<br><br>In each step here, we decorate the nodes with more info, sometimes change their shapes, sometimes merge it with others, and things like that.<br><br><hr><br><br>Here's a simplified illustration. Consider this is the initial shape of the node:<br><br><hr><br><br>Now this could be its next shape.<br><br><hr><br><br>And this could be its next shape, and so on. We had hundreds of these kinds of transformations - some small, and some big, and it was all too much for us to mentally track.<br><br>This lack of mental model made it very difficult for us to make progress. We kept making mistakes and development just slowed down.<br><br>We wanted a better way to track the changing shape of the data as they went through each transformation. And we had an inkling that types could be the answer.<br><br><hr><br><br>Which was when Jordan Walke, who originally wrote React, released the first version of Reason.<br><br>Reason was a typed language, and it compiled to Javascript. So we could rewrite all our transformation code into Reason and have it work both on Node and also on the browser.<br><br>He also shipped ReasonReact a bit later, which is the Reason adaptor for React. And thanks to that we could even build UIs in Reason and mix and match it with React components and vanilla Javascript.<br><br>So that's what we did!<br><br><hr><br><br>But learning and adopting this new language, was a bit of a struggle.<br><br>This was our go-to book at the time. Real World OCaml. It taught us a fair bit of OCaml, but we also learnt as much about programming itself this book.<br><br>But it was also a little frustrating to work through. Because OCaml's programming approach is very different from all the Javascript and Ruby that we had written before.<br><br>But the struggle was worth it.<br><br>It was worth so much<br><br>that now<br><br>when I look back on the last 10 years of my programming, I almost wonder what I was doing for the first 8 years, before I had discovered Reason and Typed Functional Programming.<br><br>And that is why I'm so excited to be here today, and talk to you all about ReasonML.<br><br><hr><br><br>So in this talk I will try to describe some interesting bits of the language - especially things that are different from Javascript.<br><br>I'll not be able to cover every single feature that makes it special, but I'll try to give a feel for how it would be to be programming with it.<br><br>I'll also talk about how to approach learning this language, based on my past experience.<br><br>Alright, now we can get started.<br><br><hr><br><br>Reason is a new syntax on top of the OCaml programming language.<br><br>OCaml has a long history - it was released about 30 years ago. It is a compiled language and produces very fast binaries.<br><br>Its syntax however is quite different from most languages that we're used to.<br><br><hr><br><br>Here is an OCaml program that prints an HTML table from a 2-dimensional list. See that function arguments are separated by spaces, and anonymous functions are created with the `fun` keyword.<br><br><hr><br><br>Here's the same OCaml code, but in the Reason syntax. This is closer to ES6 as we know it - there are braces to denote blocks. The fat arrow operator lets us create functions,; and semicolons are used for separating lines.<br><br>Underneath, however Reason and OCaml are the same language and have the same semantics.<br><br><hr><br><br>So is it actually useful? This language. What can we build with it?<br><br><hr><br><br>When you start reading about OCaml, you'll often come across Jane Street. They are one of the largest production users of the language and in 2018 about $8 trillion dollars passed through their system, and all of that used software written in OCaml.<br><br><hr><br><br>If you have done any SEO work, you might be familiar with Ahrefs. They crawl about 5 million pages every minute, and they have the second largest index just after Google. All this work is done using native OCaml.<br><br><hr><br><br>OCaml is also particularly nice to write compilers on - The very first version of the Rust compiler was written in OCaml.<br><br>Facebook is also a large user of OCaml internally, again for compiler work.<br><br>5mins<br><br><hr><br><br>Now, all these things - high frequency trading, massive web crawlers, and compilers - these are all the _traditional_ applications of OCaml.<br><br>It can also be used to build front-end web applications, which is what this talk is about.<br><br>So how is that done?<br><br><hr><br><br>OCaml has three major compilers.<br><br>The native OCaml compiler generates executable binaries that are very fast and lightweight. So if you had something you wanted to build with say GoLang, you can use OCaml or Reason instead and compile it with ocamlc.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Then there is js_of_ocaml -- it is a fork of the OCaml compiler, and it produces Javascript instead of native binaries. You can use any native OCaml library here, but it is not easy to interop with the Javascript ecosystem.<br><br><hr><br><br>The compiler we want is BuckleScript. It produces clean, performant Javascript, and it interops nicely with npm and the rest of the Javascript ecosystem.<br><br><hr><br><br>BuckleScript is also the primary compiler for Reason. And the Javascript it generates can run both on Node and on the Browser.<br><br>So for the rest of this talk, we're going to be talking about using the Reason syntax for OCaml, with the BuckleScript compiler.<br><br><hr><br><br>Okay, here's BuckleScript in action.<br><br>The code written here, though it looks like Javascript, is actually Reason. It checks whether the current day is April 1st 2020, and then shows a message if that is so.<br><br>For this it uses the momentjs Javascript library from npm.<br><br>Alright, now let's compile this.<br><br><hr><br><br>At the bottom is the Javascript produced by BuckleScript. It is straightforward JS, and it uses the CommonJS syntax to require the momentjs npm module.<br><br>That's one of the best thing about Reason: since we're using BuckleScript, we can use any npm library in our code. And since it produces regular Javascript, we can integrate it with our existing codebase as well.<br><br><hr><br><br>Let's talk a little bit about Reason's programming language paradigm.<br><br><hr><br><br>Reason is a Typed Functional language.<br><br><hr><br><br>So are languages like Elm, F#, and Haskell.<br><br>All these languages share the same Type System - it is called the Hindley Milner typesystem, and they also share a similar approach to functional programming.<br><br>So if you read say an insightful article about Elm, it is highly probable that it also applies to Reason. And vice versa.<br><br>In fact most things that I'll speak about in this talk will also apply equally well to the other Typed functional languages as well.<br><br>So when you learn Reason, you're also dipping your toes into the vast, and varied world of all Typed Functional Programming languages.<br><br><hr><br><br>Okay, so what is Typed FP?<br><br>It is just writing our programs as a series of pure functions. That's it.<br><br>How is that an improvement over Javascript you might ask? We can write JS also in a functional manner - with pure functions everywhere, and just an outer shell for all the I/O. That's essentially functional programming, and that's pretty nice.<br><br>But Reason is not only "functional", it is also "typed", and the types guarantees something:<br><br><hr><br><br>"perfection".<br><br>Reason functions are more "perfect" than functions written in Javascript. I'm using the word "perfection" here as a degree of measure and not as an absolute.<br><br>I stole the idea from Prof. Xavier Leroy, who is a programming languages researcher and also the author OCaml<br><br><hr><br><br>Prof. Leroy says that a perfect program does exactly what it should do, no more, no less, every time, with perfect reliability, and forever. The kind of perfection that you can get from mathematical definitions, which software is to a large extent, or from philosophical concepts.<br><br>But what can this mean in the context of our day-to-day work?<br><br><hr><br><br>Consider this function `showNext` - it tells you what your user id could be, based on the last user in the system.<br><br>We pass it an object with id 16, and it prints 17. The code is as simple as it can get.<br><br>But does it work perfectly reliably all the time, every time? Will it ever crash in production?<br><br><hr><br><br>What if `id` is null?<br><br><hr><br><br>Thankfully that works. Our function is resilient to nulls.<br><br><hr><br><br>What if id was a string?<br><br><hr><br><br>It doesn't crash, but the result isn't what we wanted.<br><br><hr><br><br>Now what happens when the object is empty?<br><br><hr><br><br>This is also a wrong result.<br><br><hr><br><br>Here we have a list of users, and we'll find the last of them and apply to `showNext`<br><br>But unfortunately, the list is empty. What happens now?<br><br><hr><br><br>The function actually crashes.<br><br>This is a common source of error when programming in JS - we fetch a value from an array or an object -- and sometimes it doesn't exist -- which means it returns a null or an undefined. We then pass that down to other functions.. and things crash in production. Sometimes they crash far away from the place where the undefined originated, and so we have to work backwards quite a bit to debug it.<br><br><hr><br><br>Okay, to make a long story short, none of the invokations here would work correctly.<br><br><hr><br><br>The only way the function can succeed is when it receives an object which has a field `id`, which has an integer value.<br><br>So why does Javascript allow this function to be called with any other kind of argument? What if we could write functions that will always work because they always receive the right kind of data.<br><br>It can change the way we write software.<br><br>In Reason we do this with type definitions - we can think of it is as metadata about our programs where we describe the shape and structure of all the values in the system.<br><br>So how does that work?<br><br><hr><br><br>Here is a Reason type definition; we're saying that there is a type called user<br><br><hr><br><br>which has a field `id`<br><br><hr><br><br>whose values are always integers.<br><br>Now let's write `showNext` in Reason.<br><br><hr><br><br>You can see that there is an explicit cast from integer to string, but otherwise the Reason version looks similar to the ES6 version. Let us run it.<br><br><hr><br><br>It works. Can we send this function invalid data, and break it, just like we did with the JS version?<br><br><hr><br><br>Yes it breaks! But this is a compile-time breakage. This means no Javascript code was generated for this Reason program we wrote.<br><br>That's because the compiler found a type error in the code.<br><br>It inferred that the function `showNext` expects a value of type `user`, and `user` should have an integer id column inside it. But instead of `user` we sent a random string. That'll definitely break the function in runtime, so Reason wouldn't allow it to move past compilation.<br><br><hr><br><br>Okay, here's another attempt. We're passing in a list instead of an integer. Type error.<br><br><hr><br><br>Let's try passing a function instead of the entire `user` object. Type error again.<br><br><hr><br><br>We can keep going, but the only way to get this program to compile is to pass `showNext` the correct data. That's the number one promise of Typed FP.<br><br><hr><br><br>I want to take this opportunity to try to impress upon you the important distinction between a "compile-time error" and a "runtime error".<br><br><hr><br><br>This is supposed to be a Javascript program. But it won't even execute, because the second line has an invalid syntax. The first line is valid by the way -- but it won't print anything because the whole program will be rejected.<br><br><hr><br><br>Now this error is a good thing - it is best to know problems as early in the programming cycle as possible.<br><br>But imagine if programs were executed despite syntax errors.<br><br>You'll ship it to customers, and they'll be in the middle of something, and then some closing bracket is missing somewhere and boom! the program halts to a crash.<br><br>Thankfully that doesn't happen. When was the last time we lost sleep because we worried about a syntax error in our code?<br><br><hr><br><br>The genius of Reason and Typed Functional Programming is that a lot of common mistakes become compile-time errors rather than runtime errors.<br><br>It is like our syntax checking became a lot more smarter and covers a lot more area than just missing parantheses.<br><br>Let's look at an example.<br><br><hr><br><br>Here's a Javascript program that we had looked at before.  We fetch the last user from a list, and does something with it. The list however is empty, and so `lastUser` will be undefined.<br><br><hr><br><br>So it crashes during execution with a runtime error.<br><br>In Reason however, this error sort of becomes a syntax error rather than a runtime error. The compiler will catch the mistake and we don't have to run it to see if it breaks.<br><br><hr><br><br>Here's the Reason equivalent of the same program. This won't even execute. Instead we'll get this compile-time error:<br><br><hr><br><br>What is this error message saying?<br><br>In Line 12, we're calling showNext, and it is expecting a value of type user.<br>But, the compiler is complaining that we're passing it something of type option('a).<br><br>What's happening here is that in line 11, we've tried fetching an element from the array `users`. Reason knows that whenever you fetch something from an array then it is quite possible that the element might not exist.<br><br>Which is why it is returning a value who has an optional type. So how would we write this instead?<br><br><hr><br><br>We'll replace line number 12 with this code. What we're doing is acknowledging the fact that lastUser could be empty. And we handle both cases where it can or cannot exist.<br><br>So instead of null, or undefined, Reason has the option type. When something is of the option type, it means the compiler knows that it may or may not have a value during runtime. So we're forced to deal with that situation before it will compile the code.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Option types is one of the most amazing things about Typed FP. It gives us the kind of confidence in our code that allows us to refactor mercilessly, aggressively without worrying that we'll make mistakes.<br><br>Because of this a lot of my programming anxiety went away after I started programming with Reason. I can refactor large, complex codebases confidently because I know that Reason has my back.<br><br><hr><br><br>Or in other words:<br><br>if the program compiles, it works.<br><br>It is true!<br><br>But, what about logical mistakes?<br><br><hr><br><br>Here someone asked for a tea, and we poured them a coffee.<br><br>This code is going to compile, but it is obviously wrong. This is a logical mistake, and not a type error, and so the compiler simply cannot catch it.<br><br><hr><br><br>But when I started writing typed FP after about a decade of dynamically typed languages, I realized that we programmers are a pretty decent bunch. We don't make as many logical mistakes as we think we do.<br><br>Our programs are all broken, make no mistake, but they are broken not because we wrote something when we meant the other. They're borken because of clerical mistakes. Because we passed the wrong data to the wrong function.<br><br>But the Reason compiler is very good at catching those kind of mistakes, which is why "if it compiles, it works" is an experience you can also look forward to when you start writing Reason.<br><br><hr><br><br>So far so good. But if we say that Reason can only deal with well-typed data, then how can it work with external data which our programs have no control over?<br><br><hr><br><br>like content that we read from the database<br><br><hr><br><br>or JSON API responses<br><br><hr><br><br>or even user inputs from the browser.<br><br><hr><br><br>We handle it in Reason by parsing all external data at the application boundary.<br><br><hr><br><br>If the data that hits the application doesn't slot into their corresponding types, then there is no way the data can proceed to the rest of the appliaction. Maybe it is an old API format and we're on a new version. So there is nothing to be done except reject it and return an HTTP error code.<br><br>Or the incoming data is incomplete -- but we can handle it gracefully by putting placeholder values.<br><br>The point is we cannot allow malformed data into our system. Either we handle it, or we stop the request there.<br><br><hr><br><br>But if there are no issues, then this data gets parsed into our application types, and it hits the core.<br><br><hr><br><br>We can write this core without a single defensive check; no worries about null errors; not bothered whether the objects will have the right shape. We know, thanks to types, that everything will be just perfect.<br><br><hr><br><br>What I covered so far in this talk is a very thin slice of the ideas in the Typed FP paradigm.<br><br><hr><br><br>For example we haven't looked at functional programming at all. I think that most of us who write Javascript is already doing a fair amount of FP, and especially so if you use React.<br><br>But Reason adds a few things which makes it a better functional language than JS.<br><br>I've listed some them here - these are all very worth knowing.<br><br><hr><br><br>These ideas are all around Reason's type system. They are also quite fun.<br><br><hr><br><br>Here's another set of ideas - these are from the Real World OCaml book.<br><br>If you want to know about all these things, you can find talks and blogs on the internet, but the best thing to do would be to learn Reason, build something in it and experience them yourself.<br><br><hr><br><br>So that's what we'll talk about next.<br><br>If you had to give Reason a shot, how would you go about it?<br><br><hr><br><br>First let's see what concepts you can take away from Javascript into Reason.<br><br><hr><br>Except for types, Reason is, in a sense, a subset of Javascript.<br><br>Javascript is a large language -- which could be obvious if you've participated in any Javascript job interview.<br><br>You can ask and be asked so many questions. There is the concept of `this`, there are prototypes and prototype inheritance chains, and there are also classes, objects, and mutation. It also has functions and higher-order functions.<br><br>Compared to a Javascript job interview, a Reason interview could be rather uneventful; because it is a much smaller language than JS. All it has are functions, modules, and types.<br><br><hr><br><br>So what is the fastest way to really learn Reason?<br><br>You can start by building simple user interfaces with ReasonReact. We usually learn new things by what is called programming by poking. Find a new library, copy paste some sample code, and start tweaking it till we make it work. That approach will go a long way to get you started.<br><br>But it doesn't scale for ever.<br><br><hr><br><br>It is because if you try building something real and hit a roadblock, you wouldn't know what even Google for, and where to look.<br><br>So initially you have to go through the catalog of language features and learn them -- without looking for any immediate application.<br><br><hr><br><br>The first phase is learning to program in the small.<br><br>You should be able to solve a fizzbuzz, read from a file, compute an average, make an API request -- all these things.<br><br>The concepts that you need here are quite standard: manipulating data structures in Reason, defining and applying functions etc.<br><br><hr><br><br>For this you should comb through official Reason documentation. It is specifically written for people from the Javascript world and is very accessible.<br><br><hr><br><br>Next, you need to get comfortable with the tooling.<br><br>You should be able to create a project, compile, and start tinkering on demand. That is a simple but very crucial step.<br><br>Knowing the tooling is the difference between wishing you had the time to play with something vs actually having fun with it.<br><br><hr><br><br>In Reason's case, tooling is very easy to setup.<br><br>The official setup guide is about 4 lines - install an npm package, start webpack and you're done.<br><br>I would also recommend using VSCode + the VSCode Reason plugin - it is the most supported editor for Reason.<br><br><hr><br><br>The third thing to know is to how to Program in the Large.<br><br>Have you ever been in a place where you know a thing - a language or a library - but you're not yet confident to use it in production?<br><br>The missing thing usually is not knowing how to fit things into a larger canvas. In the case of Reason, the only construct you need to know is  the `module`. It is very similar to regular JS modules -- you can put a bunch of functions together, expose only a few public ones, and that's it.<br><br><hr><br><br>The best resource for systematic study of OCaml is the book Real World OCaml. It uses the OCaml syntax, but that is easy to get used to. It is a great book because it teaches not only OCaml the language. You can also expect some very practical, very profound insights on programming as a whole, from this book.<br><br>::: notes<br><br><hr>--------<br><br><br>### Systematic study<br><br>::: notes<br><br>I want to stress this point: when learning Typed Functional Programming, you should combine learning by poking - trying to create something and tweaking and  learning from that experience, with a proper, systematic study of the language. Otherwise it can be an extremely frustrating experience.<br><br><hr><br><br>Finally, the elephant in the room. Is Reason commercially viable? Is it something you can use in your workplace?<br><br>My experience has obviously been great, and I think it is very much ready for production. For example a large chunk of Facebook's Messenger front-end is already running on Reason.<br><br>But Facebook is far away, let's take look at a project that is much closer to home..<br><br><hr><br><br>The project is called PupilFirst. It is a learning management solution - you can create courses, teach students, and manage their progress.<br><br>The entire front-end is written in Reason and compiled with BuckleScript.<br><br><hr><br><br>It has a complex data model and advanced UI patterns.<br><br><hr><br><br>It is built here in Bangalore.<br><br><hr><br><br>And it is fully open-source. One of the authors, Hari Gopal, is also a JsFoo speaker. He had spoken in last year's conference and that was also about Reason.<br><br>This is a good reference repository if you want to see a real-world reason web application that is used in production.<br><br><hr><br><br>So that was the talk Learning to Learn Reason.<br><br>Thank you so much for listening!<br><br>I hope you enjoyed it, and I'm also eager to hear your questions.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><hr><br>  </pre>
